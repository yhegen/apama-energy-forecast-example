			<!-- The File Adapter can operate one of two modes:
				
				1) Non Simple Mode, which uses the file protocol to deal with read and write
				requests. The input and output files specified below are ignored, and the 
				File Adapter will deal with explicit OpenFileToRead and OpenFileToWrite
				events. Fixed width files and CSV files have to be opened for reading in Non-Simple 
				mode due to the additional information required to understand their contents.
				
				2) Simple mode, where the adapter uses the input and output files 
				specified to write and read to. The protocol mode is turned off and therefore				 
				the adapter will only accept the following UPSTREAM events, 
				with no need to specify the sessionId on either:			     
				
					FileLine		- where the first elements contained within the data sequence
								  	  are written out delimited by the separator specified below
								  	  (having no separator is acceptable...see details below)
				
					ReadLines		- read a specified number of lines from the file. 
									  
				and will send the following DOWNSTREAM events:
				
					FileLine 		- with a data sequence of one element containing the entire line read
					
					EndOfFile		- when the end of the file being read has been reached. The adapter
									  will continue to probe the file for changes, and will send 
									  FileLine events when more are available. 
					
					FileError 		- (if an error occurred) 
					
					LineWritten 	- If required by the user when sending lines to be written, the Adapter
									  sends back an acknowledgement that the line has been written.

				 each element in the list is written immediately after the previous one. 
				 This is always overriden by the separator specified if the CSV codec (or any other
